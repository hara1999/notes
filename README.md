# What is TCP and UDP?

## 1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable communication by establishing a connection before data transfer and ensuring the data is delivered correctly and in order.

### Key Features:
1. **Connection-Oriented:**
    * A connection must be established between the sender and receiver (via a handshake) before data is sent.
2. **Reliable:**
    * Ensures data is delivered without errors, in sequence, and without duplicates.
    * Uses acknowledgments (ACKs) and retransmissions in case of data loss.
3. **Ordered Delivery:**
    * Data packets arrive in the order they were sent.
4. **Flow Control and Congestion Control:**
    * Adjusts data transmission speed based on network conditions and receiver capacity.

### Use Cases:
* Applications requiring reliability and accuracy:
    * Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
    * Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
    * File transfers (FTP)
    * Remote access (SSH, Telnet)

### Example of TCP in Action:
* Web browsing: TCP ensures that all parts of a webpage arrive correctly and in order.

## 2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides a fast but less reliable way to send data. It does not establish a connection or guarantee delivery, making it lightweight and efficient.

### Key Features:
1. **Connectionless:**
    * No handshake or connection establishment between sender and receiver.
2. **Unreliable:**
    * No guarantees that packets will arrive, arrive in order, or be error-free.
    * No retransmissions or acknowledgments.
3. **Low Overhead:**
    * Faster and more efficient due to minimal protocol overhead.

### Use Cases:
* Applications requiring low latency and real-time data:
    * Video and audio streaming
    * Online gaming
    * VoIP (Voice over IP)
    * DNS (Domain Name System) queries

### Example of UDP in Action:
* Live streaming: UDP allows data to arrive quickly, even if some packets are lost, ensuring minimal latency.

# What is the Difference Between SQL and NoSQL?

## 1. SQL Databases
SQL databases are relational databases that use structured schemas and tables to store and manage data. They rely on SQL for querying and managing the database.

### Characteristics:
* **Data Storage:**
    * Tabular format (rows and columns).
* **Transactions:**
    * ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance ensures strong consistency.

### Advantages:
1. **Structured Data:** Ideal for applications where the data has a clear structure (e.g., financial data, ERP systems).
2. **Strong Consistency:** Ensures data integrity through ACID compliance.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Scalability:** Vertical scaling (adding more power to a single server) is the primary scaling model, which can be costly.
2. **Rigidity:** Changing schemas or handling unstructured data can be challenging.

## 2. NoSQL Databases
NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed for scalability and flexibility. They handle unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.

### Characteristics:
* **Data Storage:**
    * Various formats: Key-Value pairs, Document, Column-family, Graph.
* **Transactions:**
    * Often follow BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency), allowing for relaxed consistency models.
* **Query Language:**
    * Varies by database type (e.g., query-based on JSON or key-value lookups).

### Types of NoSQL Databases:
1. **Key-Value Store:** Data stored as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
2. **Document Store:** JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).
3. **Column-Family Store:** Optimized for large datasets (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).
4. **Graph Databases:** Represent relationships between data (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB).

### Advantages:
1. **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling (adding more servers) makes it easy to handle large datasets and high traffic.
2. **Flexibility:** Handles unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., JSON, XML).
3. **Performance:** Optimized for specific use cases like high-speed lookups or complex graph queries.

### Disadvantages:
1. **Weaker Consistency:** Often trades off strong consistency for performance and availability.
2. **Less Mature Ecosystem:** Fewer standardized tools and practices compared to SQL.

# What is CAP Theorem?

The CAP theorem (also known as Brewer's theorem) is a principle in distributed systems that states it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:

1. **Consistency (C):**
    * Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
2. **Availability (A):**
    * Every request (read or write) receives a response, regardless of whether it is successful or fails.
3. **Partition Tolerance (P):**
    * The system continues to operate despite network partitions (communication breakdowns between nodes).
      

## Key Insight
The CAP theorem states that in the presence of a network partition, a distributed system can achieve at most **two out of the three guarantees**:

- **Consistency and Availability (CA):** 
    * The system is consistent and available as long as there is no network partition.
- **Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CP):** 
    * The system sacrifices availability to maintain consistency during network partitions.
- **Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP):** 
    * The system remains available but may return inconsistent results during network partitions.

## Implications
Distributed systems need to prioritize **two of the three properties** based on the application's requirements and trade-offs.\


## Real-World Considerations

### **Eventual Consistency**
- Many systems adopt a relaxed form of consistency, known as **eventual consistency**, to balance the CAP trade-offs.
- For example, in **AP systems**, data may become consistent eventually once partitions are resolved.

### **Network Partitions**
- Network partitions are relatively common in large-scale distributed systems, making **partition tolerance** a practical necessity.
- This often forces a trade-off between **consistency** and **availability**.


## Conclusion
Understanding the CAP theorem helps in designing distributed systems tailored to specific use cases, depending on whether **consistency**, **availability**, or **tolerance to network failures** is more critical.

# Difference Between Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling

## 1. Horizontal Scaling

### **Definition:**
Horizontal scaling (scale-out) involves adding more machines or nodes to a system to distribute the load.

### **Advantages:**
- **Cost-Effective:** Commodity hardware can be used instead of expensive, high-performance machines.
- **High Availability:** Load is distributed, and replication ensures data availability even if some nodes fail.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to add or remove nodes as demand fluctuates.

### **Challenges:**
- **Complexity:** Requires mechanisms like load balancing, sharding, and consistent hashing to manage distributed nodes.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensuring consistency across nodes in a distributed environment can be challenging.
- **Networking Overhead:** More nodes may increase network communication overhead.


## 2. Vertical Scaling

### **Definition:**
Vertical scaling (scale-up) involves upgrading the hardware of a single machine to increase its capacity.

### **Advantages:**
- **Simplicity:** Easier to implement since there's no need to manage multiple nodes or distribute data.
- **Performance:** Great for workloads that cannot easily be distributed (e.g., tightly coupled applications).

### **Challenges:**
- **Cost:** High-performance hardware is expensive and may not be cost-effective for large-scale systems.
- **Limited Scalability:** Thereâ€™s a limit to how much a single machine can scale.
- **Downtime:** Upgrades often require downtime, which can impact availability.

## What is a Process?
A **process** is an independent program in execution, managed by the operating system (OS).

### **Key Features of a Process:**
1. **Isolation:**
    - Each process has its own memory space (heap, stack, code, and data segments).
    - Processes do not share memory by default.
2. **Overhead:**
    - Processes are heavyweight because of their isolation. 
    - Communication between processes (Inter-Process Communication, IPC) requires additional mechanisms like pipes, sockets, or shared memory.

---

## What is a Thread?
A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Threads exist within a process and share the process's resources, such as memory and file handles.

### **Key Features of a Thread:**
1. **Shared Memory:**
    - Threads within the same process share the same memory and resources, making communication between threads faster.
2. **Lightweight:**
    - Threads have less overhead compared to processes because they share the process's resources and do not require separate memory spaces.
3. **Multithreading:**
    - Multithreading enables a single process to perform multiple tasks in parallel, enhancing performance for CPU-bound or I/O-bound tasks.

---

## When to Use Processes vs. Threads?

### **Processes:**
- Suitable for tasks that require isolation (e.g., running separate applications).
- Best for high-security requirements or fault isolation.

### **Threads:**
- Ideal for tasks within the same application that can benefit from shared memory (e.g., web servers handling multiple requests).
- Useful for improving performance with parallelism and concurrency.

# Understanding Concurrency and Parallelism

## What is Concurrency?
**Concurrency** refers to the ability to manage multiple tasks at the same time by overlapping their execution. These tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods rather than sequentially.

### **Key Features of Concurrency:**
1. **Task Switching:**
   - The system rapidly switches between tasks to give the illusion of simultaneous execution.
2. **Resource Sharing:**
   - Concurrency relies on shared resources (e.g., CPU, memory) and mechanisms like threads or processes.

### **Concurrency Use Case:**
- Improves responsiveness and resource utilization in systems with multiple tasks that can wait or depend on I/O operations.

---

## What is Parallelism?
**Parallelism** is the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks on different processors or cores. It focuses on dividing a task into smaller subtasks that can run at the same time.

### **Key Features of Parallelism:**
1. **Simultaneous Execution:**
   - Tasks run in parallel on multiple processing units (e.g., multi-core CPUs, GPUs).
2. **Independent Tasks:**
   - Tasks are independent and do not require frequent communication.
3. **Hardware Dependency:**
   - Parallelism depends on the availability of multiple processing units.

### **Parallelism Use Case:**
- Best suited for compute-intensive tasks that can be broken into smaller, independent subtasks for faster execution.
